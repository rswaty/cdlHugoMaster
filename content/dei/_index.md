As environmental stewards, the Conservation Data Lab seeks to address land management with an intersectional perspective that honors the original stewards â€“ the Indigenous communities from this land (explore the [Native Lands Map](https://native-land.ca)). Furthermore, the CDL recognizes that ecological degradation disproportionately affects marginalized communities, and that systematic racism has excluded those diverse perspectives from participating in the environmental movement and professions. As such, the work of CDL is respectful of diversity (gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, immigration status, and religion) as we believe engaging people from diverse backgrounds is essential in achieving socially just and ecologically relevant conservation outcomes. By working together to build marketable professional skills, the CDL aims to empower a diverse group of aspiring scientists to contribute in meaningful ways to the conservation of species and the land that we love. With judgement free collaboration, CDL has an entrepreneurial atmosphere where we believe everyone has something to contribute. We foster accessibility and inclusivity with flexible meeting schedules, financial support for materials when possible, and by utilizing free tools to meet our conservation goals. From assembling a group of diverse contributors to promoting social justice in our community - the Conservation Data Lab is committed to justice, equity, diversity advancement, and inclusion principles to ensure our work meets the needs of our diverse society.
