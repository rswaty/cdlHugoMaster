Allison (Alice) comes to the CDL by way of CDL founding member Cassidy Downing.  She grew up near St. Louis, MO then moved west to work with horses and maximize outdoor adventures.  She has tons of training in all things outdoors including Wilderness First Responders first aid.  She hopes to leverage the brain trust of the CDL to improve her GIS skills and the projects she is currently working on for school.
