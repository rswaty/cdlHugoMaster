Andy grew up in Lakeville, Minnesota, and earned a Bachelor of Arts in Biology and Environmental Studies (Natural Science emphasis) at St. Olaf College in the spring of 2023. During their college years, Andy had the opportunity to take up various positions working at St. Olaf's Natural Lands, getting hands-on experience with land management including invasive species control, prescribed fire, and native seed harvesting. Additionally, Andy has gained field research experience through a directed undergraduate research opportunity focused on conifer growth and reproduction, along with spending their summer in 2022 working as a Forest Ecology Field Assistant at the University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center (UNDERC).

Following their graduation, they entered a Natural Lands internship at St. Olaf, where they have been able to serve as a crew leader to students working in the Natural Lands, improve education and outreach efforts, receive training and certification for herbicide application and chainsaw use, and had the opportunity to serve as engine boss and crew member on prescribed burns. Andy is looking forward to exploring more opportunities and learning more about the field of conservation. 
 to leverage the brain trust of the CDL to improve her GIS skills and the projects she is currently working on for school.
