Gavin was raised in Ann Arbor Michigan. He very much enjoyed his time in Ann Arbor and is now living in Marquette Michigan. Year-round you'll find him doing many outdoor activities and sports including skiing biking camping. Through his love of outdoor activities, he sees it important to do his part to keep the natural world conserved so many others can also enjoy it in the future. He hopes to do this through conservation work with programs like gis. Itâ€™s been realized that for much of this data to be presented to the world a visual format is crucial and he sees it as a very important part. Going forward he is excited to gain new skills and see what's next!
