Braden is the lead copy editor and writer for the CDL. Hailing from Terre Haute, Indiana, Braden joined our crew with no ecological background. He quickly embraced our lingo, our affinity for maps and coding, and our unique way of expressing ourselves. As an undergraduate writing major, Braden served as the editor-in-chief of the Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College literary arts magazine Aurora, tutored countless students in the college’s writing lab, and is hoping to soon enter a creative non-fiction master’s program.  

Braden updated many profiles and contributed our feature piece on Sam Kurkowski’s wetlands mapping. He has pages of notes from interviewing our members, and he looks forward to speaking with new volunteers and telling their stories.
