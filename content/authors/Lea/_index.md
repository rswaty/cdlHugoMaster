Excited by what we don’t yet know about nature, Lea Kemle—self-titled “Lake Girl”—is a junior at Northern Michigan University majoring in biology with a concentration in ecology. Lea grew up in St. Claire County, where as a child she raised tadpoles from the pond, taught herself basic bush craft, and to identify birds and trees . Later, she spent three years as a veterinary assistant, where she developed an eye for microscopy  . Her idols include Steve Irwin, David Attenborough, and Jane Goodall, who together inspired Lea’s dream of working alongside research and film crews to teach about the natural world. Currently, Lea works with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in Silver Lake State Park to identify, monitor, and protect piping plovers—an at-risk bird species. Alongside the CDL, Lea is a member of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and ACE (Alliance for Climate Education). Her work with the CDL sees her use LANDFIRE data to  map past and present vegetation in Akiachak, Alaska as a humble means of empowering its villagers to manage, understand, and facilitate resources necessary to their lifestyle. Lea plans to continue her education following her undergraduate via a master’s in ecology from the University of Alaska Anchorage. 
Of the CDL she has to say, “They’re super supporters, cheerleaders, and mentors. The connections they create and the opportunities they produce are priceless.”
