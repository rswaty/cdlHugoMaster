 Lea was raised in St. Clair Michigan where her love for nature began. She enjoys hiking and using field guides to identify various plants, fungi, and animals. Living in Marquette has been an amazing experience for her due to the vast amount of people with similar interests. She is new to the Conservation Data Lab team and is excited to gain experience in remote sensing data collection. Lea has experience in veterinary science which started her love for microscopy and microbes. She has a special interest in the great state of Alaska and plans to reside and study there someday. Lea loves talking to others about their interests and opinions and has a strong drive to learn all about the natural world. Lea also is an animal and climate activist working with PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and ACE (Alliance for Climate Education) to spread compassion for animals and nature alike.
