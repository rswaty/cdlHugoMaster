Mary was raised in Plymouth, MI, about twenty minutes east of Ann Arbor. She currently attends Northern Michigan University, where she studies Environmental Science and French. At NMU, Mary works as a research assistant in a GIS lab and tutors for French. She is new to the Conservation Data Lab and is excited to learn more about conservation data analysis and how to effectively communicate it to the public. In her free time, Mary enjoys getting her hands dirty at the NMU Hoop House, reading, and exploring the many miles of trails that Marquette has to offer.
