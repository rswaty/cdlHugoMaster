Bio: Matt is a Geographic Information Systems enthusiast who is currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in GIS online at Arizona State University. After finishing a four-year contract with the US Army in 2022, Matt moved to Marquette, MI where he enjoys hiking and being outdoors. In the Army, Matt chose to become a geospatial engineer which largely involves terrain analysis and map-making. This choice sparked his love for cartography, spatial analysis, and data management while giving him experience in the ESRI suite of software.

Matt joined the CDL in hopes of learning more about environmental sciences and data analysis while also giving back with his experience in GIS. Matt’s goals include attaining formal education related to environmental science, learning Python and R, and continuing to find new and creative ways to analyze and visualize data.

Fun facts: Matt is also a skateboarder who has jumped out of planes and helicopters 13 times and can solve a Rubik’s cube in under a minute.
