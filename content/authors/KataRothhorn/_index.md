Kata is a senior undergraduate student at Northern Michigan University (NMU) majoring in Environmental Science with a concentration in water quality. She also has a minor in Native American Studies and worked within the realm of journalism for five years. She has previously done research in oral history, indigenous environmental movements, and cover crop impacts in organic farming. With the CDL, she is working to expand her knowledge of coding, how to use technology to perform statistical analysis, and then cool ways to present that information to others. Kata is hoping to explore conservation education and environmental leadership in the future. Additionally, Kata absorbs hobbies like a dry sponge and is currently saturated with the current fixations: making sourdough bread, brewing kombucha, crocheting, geocaching, singing a capella, creative writing, learning Japanese, hiking around Lake Superior, and making travel plans (both hypothetical and realistic).
