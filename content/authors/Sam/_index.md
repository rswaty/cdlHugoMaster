Sam was raised in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota and currently lives in Houghton, MI. Her love for the outdoors led to pursuing ecology and science in hopes of becoming a responsible steward of the environment. Her current graduate work is in partnership with the Michigan Tech Research Institute mapping and studying vernal pools in the Great Lakes Region for the National Park Service. They aim to understand what pool characteristics provide high quality amphibian habitat and communicate that information to landowners through a vernal pool classification system. She hopes to ultimately work in peatlands and wetland restoration. Sam recently joined the Conservation Data Lab in hopes of improving her GIS and map making skills. Besides school, Sam has been a member of the Michigan Tech Varsity Cross Country and Track & Field Team for 4 years, and has been a captain for the past year.
