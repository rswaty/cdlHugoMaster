Black Hills landscape assessment,3,"Abril Belgara-Andrew, Brandon Caltrider, Stacy Cotey, Garrett Johnson and Laura Slavsky",Spanning the border of South Dakota and Wyoming is a range of mountains known as the Black Hills. The dark forests of Ponderosa Pine and Black Hills Spruce gave the mountains their name. Changes in fire regimes have altered the vegetation types and structures. This project is designed to look at changes in the fire regimes and how the current vegetation has been altered from historic land cover.â€©,,-105,44
Hiawatha NF Fuels and Restoration Prioritization,5,Beth Teeters and Brandon Caltrider,"The Hiawatha Natioanl Forest in the Upper Peninsula of MI covers almost 900,000 ac and is highly heterogeneous, with ecosystems ranging from nearly fire-free northern hardwoods to highly fire adapted jack pines.  We are working with the Hiawatha to help map our restoration priorities.",,-87.1693069,45.7484018
Northeastern US Historical Fire Assessment,5,Anna Wright and Celeste Basken,"A surprise to many, the northeastern US (especially the southern portion) was historically dominated by fire adapted ecosystems.  These ecosystems are threatened by fire-suppression, invasive species and fragmentation.  Using LANDFIRE data, R and the modeling software SyncroSim we are exploring just how many acres would have burned annually under natural disturbance regimes.",,-76.9039567,41.0048203
What's been lost web app,5,Mathurin Gagnon,"We've combined billions of pixels of data together and present a Shiny App where you can explore levels of convertion to agriculture and urbance development, and which ecosystems have been most converted.",,-87.6782,46.6104099
Landscape assessment for an undisclosed location in Wisconsin,5,"Cole Bonino, Gavin White and Myles Walimaa",Sometimes we're just not ready to share locations…people don't always like suprises.  In a special landscape in Wisconsin we are doing the baseline vegetation assessments we hope will empower conservationists there.,,-91.6147065,43.6980299
Florida's Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve,3,Laura Roncal,"Once upon a time a preserve in Florida started collecting amazing data, but didn't have time to wrangle, analyze and present it.  That's where the Conservation Data Lab comes in.  We're looking at some amazing monitoring data, hoping to illuminate trends that lead to even better conservation.",,-84.9726955,30.4543867
Ellsworth Creek Preserve,4,Scott Benhart and Myles Walimaa,"Testing the limits of underpowered Lenovos, we're using Lidar data to explore forest thinning treatment effects in a Nature Conservancy preserve on the western edge of Washington state.",,-123.934905,46.4140357
Michigamme Highlands Assessment,5,Laura Slavsky,Beautiful places may still need serious conservation and restoration investments.  We're helping to highlight those places in the central Upper Peninsula of MI in an effort to empower the Michigan Chapter of The Nature Conservancy.,,-88.1307913,46.6576026
Central Appalachian Restoration Prioritization,3,Myles Walimaa and Cassie Begert,"This landscape ranges from northern Alabama to Maine and is where a large portion of the people of the US live.  We are working to help identify the mined areas that would, if restored make the biggest contribution to biodiversity and helping managers to understand the historic fire regimes there.",,-79.003899,37.0997296
North Central Wyoming Assessment,3,Cassidy Downing,This stunning landscape is home to charasmatic megafuana and ecosystems that are built to burn.  We are doing the basic ecosystem mapping and analysis work needed to set the stage for conservation projects.,,-108.8098066,44.7122576
Appalachian Historical Fire Mapping,5,Cassie Begert,The Appalachian Region was historically dominated by fire-adapted ecosystems.  Many of these ecosystems  would have had a surface fire every 5-10 years prior to European colonization.  Cassie worked to summarize fire regimes by hexagons for use by managers and planners,,-78.4767,38.0293
Exploring Ecosystem Representation within TNC preserves (initial focus on California),3,Myles Walimaa and Julia Olsen,"Using LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type data, Myles and Julia are comparing the relative percentages of each ecosystem inside and outside of TNC preserves. ",,-121.4944,38.5816
Michigan Forest Certification Assistance,1,Laura Slavsky and Beth Teeters,Many managed forests are certified as being managed sustainably.  The Nature Conservancy's managed lands are certified under the Forest Stewardship Council standards.  Beth Teeters and Laura Slavsky are working to assist the Michigan chapter with Principles 6 and 9 of the standard which focus on landscape assessment and High Conservation Value Areas.,,-85.5096,46.355
Wayne National Forest ecosystem and connectivity modeling,1,Avery Merritt,"Connectivity, or the ability for organisms to move across the landscape varies with vegeatation conditions.  For the Wayne NF Avery is first using SyncroSim to model potential impacts of different fire and harvest levels on ecosystems, then will use Circuitscape to assess connectivity on the resultant ""landscapes"".",,-82.4675211,39.5625676
LANDFIRE-powered Forest Stewardship Council assessments,,Keith Phelps and Stacey Marion,The Forest Stewardship Council (https://fsc.org/en) promotes sustainable management of forests.  One tool is forest certification.  To be certified forest managers are audited against criteria.  We are developing LANDFIRE-powered (https://landfire.gov/) tools to help managers be both more efficient and robust in completing environmental impact indicators within Principles 6 & 9 (https://fsc.org/en/forest-management-certification),,-89.385239,43.073929
Vermont Ecosystem Summary and Assessment,,Erin Matula,"Conservation requires knowledge at multiple scales.  Analyzing ecosytems across large area is getting easier thanks in part to large datasets such as those developed by LANDFIRE (https://landfire.gov/).  Using ArcGIS, R and other tools Erin is assessing the ecosystems of Vermont, past and present. ",,-73.210999,44.47599
Vegetation Departure for the World,,Garrett Knowlton,"International organizations such as the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature, https://www.iucn.org/) are calling for not only broader protection of global ecosystems, but also of more robust monitoring.  We are working to expand the Vegetation Departure Metric developed by LANDFIRE (and written about in Swaty et al. (2021), https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/11/1/28) to regional areas globally through use of freely available datasets and R.",,-83.748482,42.281422
Forest carbon and people demographics,,Maddie Tango and Steven Montilla-Morantes,"Conservation must be for everyone.  Maddie and Steven are exploring the nexus of carbon, ecosystems and human demography using R, QGIS, LANDFIRE and census data for the Carolinas and Georgia. ",,-73.166687,44.014179
