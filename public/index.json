Then, using public data pertaining to soil, rainfall, grazing patterns, and state transition mapping, he was able to theorize ways to optimize grazing and best sustain the grasslands in the region. With the CDL, he is learning to program in R and use ArcGIS Pro for mapping—a precursor to his project which involves utilizing data sets on carbon sequestration to predict which specific land holdings could profit most from carbon credits.

She has been expanding on her GIS work in the field, where with a drone (the DJI Matrice 300 RTK) she collects LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and NIR (near- infrared) data which can later be translated to maps.

In one such instance, she was picking dill between head high plants full of bees, when a flock of birds blacked out the sky above her—a mesmerizing moment which confirmed her desire to work with nature first-hand.

Her early experiences bounding on tussock sedges, searching for salamanders under logs, taking spring ephemeral and rhododendron walks, and racing her sister up the ridge had a lasting imprint on her personal and professional life.\nEarly in her career she pursued organic farming and agricultural sciences, a pursuit that brought her from upstate New York to Madison, Wisconsin. After working in agricultural sciences, she was pulled back by the allure of natural plant communities and transitioned to a career in ecological restoration.\nAs a Restoration Ecologist, she developed and implemented science-based ecological restoration in southwest Wisconsin, where she developed an intimate relationship with the land, especially prairies, wetlands, and woodlands. She was a Board member on the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council where she helped implement prescribed fire-related policy.\nIn advancing her GIS, programming, and design skills through an M.S. in GIS and Cartography at UW-Madison (2021), she now explores human-land use interactions from a geographer’s view. She currently works as a GIS Analyst at HDR, Inc. in Seattle, Washington.

You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python\rimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;)\rdata.head()\r```\rrenders as\nimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;)\rdata.head()\rCharts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}\r{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\rrenders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\rrenders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid\rgraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\r```\rrenders as\ngraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\rAn example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid\rsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\r```\rrenders as\nsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\rAn example Gantt diagram:\n```mermaid\rgantt\rsection Section\rCompleted :done, des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08\rActive :active, des2, 2014-01-07, 3d\rParallel 1 : des3, after des1, 1d\rParallel 2 : des4, after des1, 1d\rParallel 3 : des5, after des3, 1d\rParallel 4 : des6, after des4, 1d\r```\rrenders as\ngantt\rsection Section\rCompleted :done, des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08\rActive :active, des2, 2014-01-07, 3d\rParallel 1 : des3, after des1, 1d\rParallel 2 : des4, after des1, 1d\rParallel 3 : des5, after des3, 1d\rParallel 4 : des6, after des4, 1d\rAn example class diagram:\n```mermaid\rclassDiagram\rClass01 \u0026lt;|-- AveryLongClass : Cool\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Class01\rClass09 --\u0026gt; C2 : Where am i?\rClass09 --* C3\rClass09 --|\u0026gt; Class07\rClass07 : equals()\rClass07 : Object[] elementData\rClass01 : size()\rClass01 : int chimp\rClass01 : int gorilla\rclass Class10 {\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;service\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\rint id\rsize()\r}\r```\rrenders as\nclassDiagram\rClass01 \u0026lt;|-- AveryLongClass : Cool\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Class01\rClass09 --\u0026gt; C2 : Where am i?\rClass09 --* C3\rClass09 --|\u0026gt; Class07\rClass07 : equals()\rClass07 : Object[] elementData\rClass01 : size()\rClass01 : int chimp\rClass01 : int gorilla\rclass Class10 {\r\u0026lt;\u0026lt;service\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\rint id\rsize()\r}\rAn example state diagram:\n```mermaid\rstateDiagram\r[*] --\u0026gt; Still\rStill --\u0026gt; [*]\rStill --\u0026gt; Moving\rMoving --\u0026gt; Still\rMoving --\u0026gt; Crash\rCrash --\u0026gt; [*]\r```\rrenders as\nstateDiagram\r[*] --\u0026gt; Still\rStill --\u0026gt; [*]\rStill --\u0026gt; Moving\rMoving --\u0026gt; Still\rMoving --\u0026gt; Crash\rCrash --\u0026gt; [*]\rTodo lists You can even write your todo lists in Academic too:\n- [x] Write math example\r- [x] Write diagram example\r- [ ] Do something else\rrenders as\nWrite math example Write diagram example Do something else Tables Represent your data in tables:\n| First Header | Second Header |\r| ------------- | ------------- |\r| Content Cell | Content Cell |\r| Content Cell | Content Cell |\rrenders as\nFirst Header Second Header Content Cell Content Cell Content Cell Content Cell Callouts Academic supports a shortcode for callouts, also referred to as asides, hints, or alerts.
